        <li>4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 slices onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch onion powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a bowl, reserving bacon grease in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Combine spinach, mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, salt, and ground black pepper to taste in the skillet with bacon grease; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a bowl and place in the freezer to cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and cream together in a bowl; stir in 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Add cooled vegetables and bacon to egg mixture and mix gently.</li>
        <li>Scoop 1/4 cup egg mixture into each muffin cup; top each with remaining Colby-Jack cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until egg cups are set, about 20 minutes.</li>
